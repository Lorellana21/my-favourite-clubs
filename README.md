# My favourite clubs

### What is that?👈

This is a review exercise made when we reached the middle of the React module at the Bootcamp. 🚀

It consists of painting a list of clubs which, in turn, contains a list of members.👨‍👨‍👧‍👦

And all of this data related to the clubs, the icon they use and their membership list can be found at a constant stream of information.

**Instructions**

Adding our data constant to the `App.js` file we need to paint the list of clubs with:

- Icon 👌
- Club name
- List of members

In the first phase the important thing is to paint the data, but the aim is to create two more components:

- `ClubList.js` with the list of clubs
- `Club.js` with a card for each club
