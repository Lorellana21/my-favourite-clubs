# My favourite clubs

### What is this for?

This is a review exercise when we reached the middle of the React module at the Bootcamp. It consists of painting a list of clubs which in turn contains a list of members.
For this we had to create 2 componentsthis is a review exercise when we were in the middle of the react module. It consists of painting a list of clubs which in turn contains a list of members.
And all this information can be found at a constant stream of information about our favourite clubs, the icon they use and their membership list.

**Instructions**

Adding our data constant to the `App.js` file we need to paint the list of clubs with:

- Icon
- Club name
- List of members

In the first phase the important thing is to paint the data, but the aim is to create two more components:

- ClubList.js with the list of clubs
- Club.js with each card of each club
